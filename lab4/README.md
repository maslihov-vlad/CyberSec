# Lab 4: Enforcing a Policy

>The main goal of this lab work is to develop a desktop application which
will help us to parse and scan .audit policy files, which are provided by
some Security Companies (like CIS or Tenable). The parsed files should be
saved locally in a structured form and include next features:

### Required features:

(from previous lab)
- Choose which options they would like to run (by selecting or deselecting options);
- Search by name for an option (via a search bar);
- Select or deselect all options in one click;
- Create and save a policy that contains only the selected options under the same name or
a different one;
- Perform an audit of the workstation, using the options that were selected;
- Output the results of the audit on screen.

(new features)

•Select the settings to be enforced (a subset of ”Failed”, or all of them);
•Enforce the policy on at least 5 settings (edit the selected settings in your system);
•Rollback to the system’s initial settings.

### Used Technologies:

- Windows 10 
- Python
- Tkinter GUI package


To run the application write the following command (using Python 3.8.2): 
```sh
$  python3 main.py
```

P.S: I dont know why, but after third lab while testing - something has gone wrong and know it always says that "path not found", I'm still looking how to fix it, I have tested it in friends PC and it works well, but he doesnt want to make video on his PC, dont know why)
