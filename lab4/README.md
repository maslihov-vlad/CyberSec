# Lab 4: Enforcing a Policy

>The main goal of this lab work is to develop a desktop application which
will help us to parse and scan .audit policy files, which are provided by
some Security Companies (like CIS or Tenable). The parsed files should be
saved locally in a structured form and include next features:

### Required features:

- Select the settings to be enforced (a subset of ”Failed”, or all of them);
- Enforce the policy on at least 5 settings (edit the selected settings in your system);
- Rollback to the system’s initial settings

### Used Technologies:

- Windows 10 
- Python
- Tkinter GUI package
- Xming Server
- PyCharm

### Installation
This lab requires [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) to run. Also install Tkinter before running the main.py.

To run the application write the following command (using Python 3.8.2): 
```sh
$  python3 main.py
```
> All the information about lab is reflected in .py scripts in form of commentaries.
