# Lab 1: Importing Compliance Audit Policies

>The main goal of this lab work is to develop a desktop application which
will help us to parse and scan .audit policy files, which are provided by
some Security Companies (like CIS or Tenable). The parsed files should be
saved locally in a structured form for next manipulations in the next labs.

### Used Technologies:

- Windows 10 
- Python
- Tkinter GUI package

### Installation
 Install Tkinter before running the main.py.

To run the application write the following command (using Python 3.8.2): 
```sh
$  python3 main.py
```
