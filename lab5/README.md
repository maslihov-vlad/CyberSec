# Lab 5: Enforcing a Policy (cont’d)

>The main goal of this lab work is to develop a desktop application which
will help us to parse and scan .audit policy files, which are provided by
some Security Companies (like CIS or Tenable). The parsed files should be
saved locally in a structured form and include next features:

### Required features:

- Select the settings to be enforced (a subset of ”Failed”, or all of them);
- Enforce the policy on at least 20 settings (edit the selected settings in your system);
- Rollback to the system’s initial settings.

### Used Technologies:

- Windows 10 
- Python
- Tkinter GUI package

### Installation

To run the application write the following command (using Python 3.8.2): 
```sh
$  python3 main.py
```
